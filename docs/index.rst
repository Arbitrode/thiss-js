Welcome to The Identity Selector Service's documentation!
=========================================================

This is the component package for the thiss.io suite. This package is used to run use.thiss.io and service.seamlessaccess.org. The package contains a set of javascript components implementing a shared persistence service for Identity Provider selections and a set of services built on top of that API including a SAML discovery service and an active login button component.

Use together with the `thiss-ds-js <https://github.com/TheIdentitySelector/thiss-ds-js>`_ package.
